# PoundSenseUK Pages

This repository hosts a collection of static HTML pages published via GitHub Pages.

The pages are designed to answer specific, narrow consumer questions clearly and directly.  
Each page is standalone, lightweight, and intentionally simple.

## What this repo is
- A set of static reference pages
- Plain HTML (no frameworks, no build tools)
- Deployed automatically via GitHub Pages
- Low-maintenance by design

## What this repo is not
- A blog
- A web application
- A CMS
- A design or branding project

## Structure
- Each HTML file represents a single page
- Filenames match the question being answered
- Pages are independent and do not rely on shared scripts or styles

## Deployment
Pages are served at:

https://poundsenseuk.github.io/

Any committed HTML file in the root of this repository becomes publicly accessible.

## Maintenance philosophy
- Pages are created, published, and left alone
- Updates are optional, not required
- No ongoing operational dependencies

This repository prioritises durability, clarity, and simplicity over optimisation.
