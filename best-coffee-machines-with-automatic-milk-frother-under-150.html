        <h2>Reality check: “automatic milk” under £150</h2>
        <p class="small muted">
          At this price, you’re usually choosing between (a) a <b>built-in milk reservoir</b> that dispenses foam for you,
          or (b) a <b>frothing system</b> that’s “semi-automatic” (you still clean it every time and sometimes tweak settings).
          The best choice is the one you’ll actually use daily without resenting it.

        <h2>How to choose (fast, without becoming a coffee philosopher)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>If you want milk drinks daily:</b> pick the machine with the best combo of <b>high ratings</b> + <b>removable milk reservoir</b> (easier to keep clean).</li>
          <li><b>If you hate cleaning:</b> avoid anything where milk runs through lots of tiny channels; choose the simplest removable container system and rinse it immediately after use.</li>
          <li><b>If you want “proper espresso” vibes:</b> pressure helps, but consistency matters more — choose a well-reviewed machine and use fresh coffee + correct grind.</li>
          <li><b>If you want family volume:</b> bigger water tank = fewer refills (and fewer reasons to abandon the habit).</li>

        <div class="fact">
          <b>Review reality (what buyers tend to mention)</b>
          Convenient milk drinks and easy day-to-day use, but some users report milk not being “piping hot” and overall performance being a bit inconsistent.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><b>Who should buy this?</b> People who want a straightforward latte/cappuccino button workflow and like the all-in-one design. It’s not the highest-rated on this list, so it’s more of a “features for the money” choice than a “safest bet” choice.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Pros:</b> integrated milk container, simple drink modes, decent tank size for the footprint.</li>
        <li><b>Cons:</b> lower average rating than the front-runners; temperature consistency is a common budget-machine complaint.</li>

      <h3>Swan SK22154 (Touch controls + presets)</h3>
      <p class="kicker">Best for: people who want a touchscreen / preset-drink UI — but only if you’re comfortable taking a punt.</p>

      <div class="facts">
        <div class="fact">
          <b>Key specs</b>
          20-bar pump • digital touch controls • multiple presets • built-in automatic milk frother • 500ml milk tank

        <div class="fact">
          <b>Review reality</b>
          This listing has a noticeably lower average rating than the others. That usually means either reliability issues, inconsistent results, or expectations not matching reality.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><b>My take:</b> If you’re building your first “coffee machine habit”, reliability matters. A low rating doesn’t mean “never buy” — it means “buy only if you’re specifically attracted to the UI/features and accept the risk”.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Pros:</b> presets + touchscreen convenience; 500ml milk tank can cover multiple drinks before refill.</li>
        <li><b>Cons:</b> weakest review performance in this group; higher chance you’ll end up returning it or falling out of love.</li>

      <h3>Breville One-Touch CoffeeHouse (VCF107)</h3>
      <p class="kicker">Best overall: strongest ratings here + a straightforward milk-drinks workflow (great “default choice”).</p>

      <div class="facts">
        <div class="fact">
          <b>Key specs</b>
          19-bar Italian pump • 1.4L water tank • 600ml removable milk reservoir • one-touch drinks • ESE pod compatible
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
          <b>Why it wins for most people</b>
          When a budget machine has lots of reviews and a strong average rating, it’s usually doing the boring stuff right: consistent espresso base, manageable cleaning, and fewer nasty surprises.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><b>Who should buy this?</b> If you want lattes/cappuccinos without becoming an espresso hobbyist, this is the safest bet on your list. It has the clearest “set it up once, use it daily” vibe.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Pros:</b> strong review profile; easy drink selection; milk reservoir is removable (handy for fridge storage + cleaning).</li>
        <li><b>Cons:</b> like all milk systems, it needs rinsing after milk drinks; not a bean-to-cup grinder machine.</li>

        <div class="fact">

        <div class="fact">
          <b>Review reality</b>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p><b>Who should buy this?</b> If you care about fewer refills and a “household workhorse” vibe, this is a strong option. It’s also a good pick if you’re happy doing a tiny bit of barista ritual (but still want milk help).</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Pros:</b> big tank; solid ratings; good value; milk container included for latte-style drinks.</li>
        <li><b>Cons:</b> more hands-on than a true fully-automatic bean-to-cup milk system; milk cleanup still matters.</li>

      <h2>FAQ (quick but useful)</h2>

      <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px">Does higher “bar pressure” mean better coffee?</h3>
      <p class="muted small" style="margin:0">
        Not automatically. 15–20 bar is common marketing territory. What matters more is grind size, tamping, temperature stability, and whether the machine produces consistent shots.
        Treat bar as “table stakes”, then let reviews + ease-of-use decide.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px">What is “automatic milk frothing” in practice?</h3>
      <p class="muted small" style="margin:0">
        It means the machine helps create foam without you steaming milk with a wand. You still need to rinse milk parts after use — milk is basically dairy glue if left to dry.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px">What’s the biggest mistake with milk machines?</h3>
      <p class="muted small" style="margin:0">
        Buying a “clever” milk system and then never cleaning it properly. If you want long-term happiness: rinse immediately, do a deeper wash regularly, and don’t let milk sit warm inside anything.
